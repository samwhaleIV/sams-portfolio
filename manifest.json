That is to say, the UI is actually a single baked texture; immediate mode rendering, pushed to its limits. Notice the texture clamping bug at the bottom of the UI layer (A solid black line)."

                    "description": "To achieve maximum level design efficiency, I reinvented the wheel to create a custom, tile-based level-editor. Using a sophisticated level data encoder, each layer of a map was compressed by seperate, nominal compression algorithms. To put it simply, the game's map database was unlikely to ever exceed 1 megabyte. The editor includes specialized fill and pattern matching functions for consistent environment decoration, that is highly tedious and time consuming to do by hand."

                    "description": "Toward the end of the project, I pushed the boundaries of what the engine was capable of. I created a system for environments that were no longer restricted to tile based layouts. This editor included an intuitive drag and drop interface with a list of game entities. An entity can be dragged around to a position and clicked on to access its list of properties. It existed as a standalone program, independent from the web browser. Additionally, the shading of the terrain itself was done at runtime, allowing for much quicker iteration and greater possibilities in artistic expression."

                    "description": "Creating efficient realtime lighting effects in a web browser, with JavaScript, in an immediate mode OpenGL context that has the potential to fallback to a software renderer sounds like a C++ programmer's personal Hell. Which is why when you do something this stupid you also have to do it incredibly craftily and work with the limitations you have. This shadow effect uses subtractive lighting. Essentially path tracing in reverse. The world starts full bright (as, more or less, the whole engine is) and the shadows are carved out on a seperate rendering context, backed by a lower-than-screen-resolution map."
