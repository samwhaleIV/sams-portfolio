        <h2>
          While I've created many projects, most of them, visually, do not stand
          out in any significant way. Code is code. A command line output isn't
          very interesting to look at. Nor is middleware or APIs. Therefore,
          this portfolio consists primarily of video game projects that I
          created, using various programing languages and frameworks.

              A reimagination of my first, major game development project with
              more years of experience, Elves raised the bar in my standards for
              code quality, user experience, and interface design.

                  No good game is complete without a splash screen. So, I took
                  it literally. Having written the engine in scratch using C#
                  and critical concern for realtime performance, this scene is
                  rendered in 3D with orthographic projection, using a simple
                  particle system to represent the elves floating by through the
                  water. No memory is allocated on the heap after the first
                  initialization. It could run on this screen forever until your
                  computer or power fails.

                  Difficult to demonstrate with static images, the background is
                  a custom, infinitely scrolling dynamic shader, with realtime
                  pan, rotation, and zoom effects. The UI system in the engine
                  is written from the ground up (using a hybrid immediate mode
                  approach) to allow for extremely simple to design motion
                  graphics. Every UI element is screen size responsive and able
                  to be animated as the context demands it. The real work house
                  is the input system behind this all, allowing for keyboard
                  focusing, gamepad control, mouse, and touch input, all while
                  being opaque to the UI rendering and logic layers. It was a
                  'why re-invent' the wheel approach, but in the project it
                  allowed for extremely responsive user experience. Using the UI
                  just 'feels right'.

                  Typing your name is boring. Writing your name in low-def with
                  a mouse or joystick is a way more fun user experience. Well,
                  maybe not fun in the traditional sense, but for a game about
                  evil Christmas elves, wacky is the standard definition of fun.
                  The name tag bitmap format is extremely compressed, using bit
                  manipulation to store 1-dimensional pixels into 8 bits of a
                  byte.

                  the currently selected elf and the next/previous. The

                  To achieve maximum level design efficiency, I reinvented the
                  wheel to create a custom, tile-based level-editor. Using a
                  sophisticated level data encoder, each layer of a map was
                  compressed by seperate, nominal compression algorithms. To put
                  it simply, the game's map database was unlikely to ever exceed
                  1 megabyte. The editor includes specialized fill and pattern
                  matching functions for consistent environment decoration, that
                  is highly tedious and time consuming to do by hand.

                  Toward the end of the project, I pushed the boundaries of what
                  the engine was capable of. I created a system for environments
                  that were no longer restricted to tile based layouts. This
                  editor included an intuitive drag and drop interface with a
                  list of game entities. An entity can be dragged around to a
                  position and clicked on to access its list of properties. It
                  existed as a standalone program, independent from the web
                  browser. Additionally, the shading of the terrain itself was
                  done at runtime, allowing for much quicker iteration and
                  greater possibilities in artistic expression.

                  Creating efficient realtime lighting effects in a web browser,
                  with JavaScript, in an immediate mode OpenGL context that has
                  the potential to fallback to a software renderer sounds like a
                  C++ programmer's personal Hell. Which is why when you do
                  something this stupid you also have to do it incredibly
                  craftily and work with the limitations you have. This shadow
                  effect uses subtractive lighting. Essentially path tracing in
                  reverse. The world starts full bright (as, more or less, the
                  whole engine is) and the shadows are carved out on a seperate
                  rendering context, backed by a lower-than-screen-resolution
                  map.

                  As in all my projects, accessibility is a major concern.
                  Whether you are using a mouse only, keyboard, joystick,
                  touchscreen, or other impulse based devices, I believe that it
                  is a necessity to accomodate a user on their preferred
                  platform and physical abilities. Input logic and input
                  processing are two different tasks. With this moduality,
                  scenes such as this (simulating a bound, 2-axis claw machine)
                  are allowed to to operate in logical, device specific ways
                  while keeping the hazards of managing input state away from
                  the game designer.

                  configurations. This user controllable boat was also a major
                  learning effort in rigid body simulation and intertial effects
                  of fluid dynamics. That it so say, combined with the

                  Drawing every tile frame by frame isn't efficient enough for
                  real time gameplay. The game is built on a tile state manager,
                  that maintains an unscaled back-buffer of specific game
                  layers. When a change is requested on an update cycle, the
                  appropriate back buffer is updated. While the resolution of
                  the game is high, in 1:1 pixel scale, performance was not a
                  concern for modern hardware with much greater swapping
                  capabilities. The browser gets to do the heavy lifting. So, of
                  course, the game environments are highly dynamic. A map is
                  loaded with a preset state and can be modified in any way at
                  runtime.

                  will have to imagine it is. It's an infinite trailing tunnel

                  their opponent's boards. Yeah, networking is cool and all, but
                  you can't beat the joy of human error in a high precision game
                  such as battle ship. So pull up a Discord call, place some
                  boats, and fight a game of statistical probability.

                  Each elf was an experiment to how far a simple format could be
                  pushed. 4 programmable buttons, 1 speech box, and a few extra
                  lines of text. While the game's shell was simple, its
                  complexity was much higher because there was no limit to what
                  a creative game designer can accomplish with these
                  restrictions. It was a text adventure wrapped in a shinier
                  exterior, with elves and battles consisting of everything from
                  trivia games, mathematical puzzles, and tradtional RPG style
                  battles.

                  In hindsight, it's hard me to believe this project only took 4
                  months. Looking back on the code now, it's an abomination, but
                  it was a significant milestone in my software and game
                  development journey. The first major project that I feel as
                  though I truly completed. I only earned about $5 in the end,
                  but it didn't matter. I was happy with the product, even
                  though it is not up to my modern standards.

                  I can't honestly say what was going through my mind when I
                  made this waterfall meets lava lamp page, but nobody can claim
                  I wasn't trying to be creative. Through this project, I would
                  eventually push the Chromium browser so hard I'd stumble into
                  graphical context switching bugs with the Chromium shell
                  itself, which started a long and lengthy process of getting
                  the bug fixed. Ironically, this was a great learning
                  experience in managing enterprise grade software and industry
                  standard bug tracking and fixing procedures. Triaging Google
                  Chrome is not fun. It's complex enough to be its own operating
                  system. Shoutout to the Google employees that knew more about
                  the problem than I did. It eventually got fixed.

                  I had an early eye for accessibility. So many projects get
                  this wrong, but if you focus on accessibility from the start,
                  it's easy to keep it up. Going back and adding missing
                  accessibility later is a much more challenging prospect. While
                  all the UI in this game was technically HTML5 based, it was
                  rendered in a 2D rendering context, independent from the HTML
                  DOM. I eventually realized this approach was misguided in
                  other projects, where I instead chose to leverage the standard
                  HTML layout engine for even greater UI capabilities. For this
                  project, it kept things 'hypothetically' portable, but in
                  practice, decouplin this project from the browser would have
                  been a herculean task.

                  Again, this was my first real project in top-down, 2D
                  rendering. While it seems trivial to me now, this was
                  foundational in building my knowledge of building far superior
                  technology that would eventually eclipse this project
                  entirely.
